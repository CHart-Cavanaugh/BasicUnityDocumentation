                1) Unity is a game engine (which is a development environment used to make video games for different platforms).
                2) Besides being useful for making video games, Unity can also be used to make regular applications (such as 
                   applications on desktop and mobile devices).
                3) Some examples of video games that were made using Unity include:

                1) In order to work on projects in Unity, developers need to have: the necessary programs
                   downloaded and installed, an account with Unity, and a license added to their Unity account.
                2) The necessary programs that developers need in order to work on projects in Unity are:
                3) Unity offers different licenses in order for developers to use their editor (which includes a free
                   license to get started with).
                4) To obtain a license for using Unity, developers must have a Unity account.

        Downloading And Installing Unity Hub

            Useful Questions

                0) [START]
                1) Why does Unity Hub need to be downloaded and installed before Unity can be installed?
                2) What is Unity Hub used for?
                3) Where does someone go to download Unity Hub?

            Topic Qualities

                0) [START]
                1) In order to install Unity, developers will need to first install Unity Hub.
                2) Unity Hub is program for viewing existing installs of Unity or installing new versions, 
                   creating new or opening existing Unity projects, accessing different resources for 
                   learning Unity, accessing different community resources, and quick access to a Unity
                   account.
                3) To download Unity Hub, developers can go to the link below and click on the button 
                   labeled "Download Unity Hub".

                    0) [START]
                    1) Download Unity: https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download
                    n) [END]

                4) After following the link to the Unity site, developers will notice that the site will 
                   give them the option to download Unity directly without Unity Hub, but they should ignore that 
                   option for now because Unity Hub will give them a place to manage their Unity installs and make 
                   it easy to open or create Unity projects. Once Unity Hub is downloaded, they will need to 
                   open the installer and install Unity Hub similary to how they would install any other 
                   program. Once Unity Hub is installed, they should go ahead and open it on their 
                   computer and familiarize themselves with Unity Hub's interface (understanding all the core 
                   features as outlined by this subsection).

                2) What are the different licenses that someone can add to their account in order to use Unity?
                3) Where should a developer go to compare the different licenses that Unity has to offer?

            Topic Qualities

                0) [START]
                1) At some point, Unity Hub is going to ask developers to log into their Unity account.
                2) Unity Hub does this because Unity allows developers play around with the Unity editor before
                   requiring them to have a license for further use.
                3) To get started, developers should go to the link below and sign up for a Unity account.

                    0) [START]
                    1) Sign-Up for a Unity ID (Unity Account): 
                       https://id.unity.com/en/conversations/2248e7b0-9bad-485d-a41a-d12717dd47bd004f?view=register
                    n) [END]

                4) Once developers have signed up for a Unity account (or already have a pre-existing account),
                   they should log into their account on Unity Hub and use Unity Hub to access their account 
                   in a browser (this will ensure that they are logged in on both the website and Unity Hub).
                5) After developers have their Unity accounts set up and are logged in, they will need to add 
                   a license to their account in order to use Unity.
                6) Unity offers 5 different payment plans for adding a license to an account, which include:

                    0) [START]
                    1) The "Personal" plan (for developers making less than 100k with Unity in the last year)
                    2) The "Student" plan (for students)
                    3) The "Unity Plus" plan (for developers making less than 200k with Unity in the last year)
                    4) The "Unity Pro" plan (for professionals)
                    5) The "Enterprise" plan (for large organizations)
                    n) [END]

                7) For a comparison of what each plan has to offer and how much each costs, developers should go to the 
                   link below:

                    0) [START]
                    1) Compare Unity Licensing Plans: https://store.unity.com/compare-plans
                    n) [END]

                8) For just getting started with Unity, developers should add the personal license to their account (which 
                   allows them to use Unity for free and suggests that they have made less than 100k with Unity in the 
                   last year).
                9) Once they have added a license to their account (which they can confirm by going to
                   their account settings and looking under "My Seats"), they are now ready to use the Unity editor.
                n) [END]

                   installs of the Unity editor.
                02) Developers can use this section of Unity Hub to view the versions of Unity that they currently have 
                   installed on their system, to add modules to the versions of Unity they have installed, to uninstall
                   versions of Unity they no longer wish to use, or to install new versions of Unity.

                04) When installing a new version of the Unity editor, developers should choose versions that have long-term

                09) Developers can choose to add the "Microsoft Visual Studio Community" module later on to use that program
                   for writing code, but this documentation will be covering how to use the "Microsoft Visual Studio Code" 
                   program as their IDE for Unity projects instead.
                10) After selecting modules to add to their Unity installation, developers should then click on install to install
                    the selected version of the Unity editor with the selected modules.
